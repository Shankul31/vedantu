kindly run sudo npm i to install all the dependencies
I have used contextApi as a state management.
This app is built using Function components(No class Components). Since react community is encouraging to use function components instead of class components.
To maintain states i have used built-in react hooks.
I havn't find the tags e.g. javascript,react for each repo, hence type and language filter won't work.# vedantu
